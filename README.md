# Mulon Developer Guide
Hello, I am glad you are here, before you are ready and able to work, I would like you to read this documentation first before you can proceed to the next task, 

## Mulon
Mulon is a technology startup that works on environmental issues, Mulon offers a new approach for the surrounding community to use a fast and responsive waste collection service and together take responsibility for solving environmental problems using technology and digitization.

I believe with the presence of Mulon we can together reduce the amount of waste that does not reach the landfill in a much better way.
  
#### What will you develop here?
In the mulon work environment I have provided the mulon web application version 0.1.0 as our initial foundation to start working, in this application we use monorepoo to develop the initial application and also solve problems during development.
